# Book app
This is my first ever Vue app. I've build it for an assignment for a job application at DTT. 

## View result
To see the page I created visit https://jeanettt.github.io/book-app

## View source code
The source code of this project is located at the source-code branch. 
To view the project locally:
* download the code from the source-code
* open in your IDE
* run ```npm -i```
* run ```npm run serve```

## Approach
1. First I watch tutorials from Vue Mastery.
2. Then I made a lot of test apps
3. Finally i made the final app
