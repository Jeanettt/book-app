    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>I am...</h3>
    <p>...Jeanette de Waard. I love to alternate between screen time and the outdoors. I live near the beach, together with my awesome guy. My current goal is to switch from webdesigner to front end developer.</p>
    <h3>Why Front End Development?</h3>
    <p>I enjoy multimedia design, but I think my true power will lie in front end development. I like the technical aspects of it. For the past 6 months I have been focussing on learning how to code. Then I landed a small traineeship at a <a href="https://pxlwidgets-heroes.com/" target=“_blank”>digital agency</a>. Now my goal is to land a full Traineeship. For my full profile, view my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanettedewaard/" target=“_blank”>LinkedIn page</a> and for my recent projects, view my <a href="https://github.com/Jeanettt/" target=“_blank”>Github page</a>.</p>
    <h3>Why I am applying at DTT</h3>
    <p>DTT seems like a professional company and like a great place to learn. I would love be part of such a cool team!</p>
